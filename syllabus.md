## Course Overview

Most of us are aware we are being tracked by companies around the world, but we aren’t really sure why it matters or what we can do about it. What does incognito mode even do? What browser extensions do you need to protect yourself? Does using a VPN make you 100% private?

This course is designed to answer questions like these and help you understand why your online privacy matters, how you are being tracked, and what you can do protect yourself. Each week, students will be introduced to tools to help them reduce their digital footprint and protect their personal data.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of taking this course, students will:

1. Understand how software is used to track users across the web

2. Be knowledgeable of tools to prevent tracking

3. Be familiar with privacy-respecting alternatives to popular websites and services

## Prerequisites

This class does not require any prior knowledge except basic computer skills. However, some (optional) assignments will require more technical expertise.

## Class Website

This class will use bCourses, which can be accessed at https://bcourses.berkeley.edu using a valid Berkeley email. Assignments, slides, announcements, and other course-related materials will be posted here.
